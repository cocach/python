    "Making up all living material, the **cell** is considered to be the building block of life. The **nucleus**, a component of most **eukaryotic** cells, was identified as the hub of cellular activity 150 years ago. Viewed under a light microscope, the nucleus appears only as a darker region of the cell, but as we increase magnification, we find that the nucleus is densely filled with a stew of macromolecules called **chromatin**. During **mitosis** (eukaryotic cell division), most of the chromatin condenses into long, thin strings called **chromosomes**. See Figure 1 for a figure of cells in different stages of mitosis.\n",

    "**细胞**作为构成所有生物原料被认为是生命的基石。**细胞核**是大多数**真核细胞**的组成部分，150年前被确定为细胞活动的中心。在光学显微镜下观察，细胞核仅作为细胞的较暗区域出现，但随着我们增加放大倍数，我们发现细胞核密集地充满了称为**染色质**的大分子物质。在**有丝分裂**期间（真核细胞分裂），大多数染色质浓缩成长而细的细胞串，称为**染色体**。有关有丝分裂不同阶段的细胞图见下图。\n",

    "One class of the macromolecules contained in chromatin are called **nucleic acids**. Early 20th century research into the chemical identity of nucleic acids culminated with the conclusion that nucleic acids are **polymers**, or repeating chains of smaller, similarly structured molecules known as **monomers**. Because of their tendency to be long and thin, nucleic acid polymers are commonly called **strands**.\n",
    "\n",
    "染色质中含有的一类大分子称为**核酸**。20世纪早期对核酸化学特性的研究最终得出结论：核酸是**聚合物**，或者将这种重复结构的称为**单体**。由于它们倾向于长而薄，核酸聚合物通常被称为**链**。\n",
    "\n",
    "The nucleic acid monomer is called a **nucleotide** and is used as a unit of strand length (abbreviated to nt). Each nucleotide is formed of three parts: a **sugar** molecule, a negatively charged **ion** called a phosphate, and a compound called a **nucleobase** (\"base\" for short). Polymerization is achieved as the sugar of one nucleotide bonds to the phosphate of the next nucleotide in the chain, which forms a **sugar-phosphate backbone** for the nucleic acid strand. A key point is that the nucleotides of a specific type of nucleic acid always contain the same sugar and phosphate molecules, and they differ only in their choice of base. Thus, one strand of a nucleic acid can be differentiated from another based solely on the order of its bases; this ordering of bases defines a nucleic acid's **primary structure**.\n",
    "\n",
    "核酸单体称为**核苷酸**，并作为链长度的单位（缩写为*nt*）。每个核苷酸由三部分组成：**糖分子**，带有负离子的**磷酸盐**，和**核碱基**化合物（简称“碱基”）。当一个核苷酸的糖与链中下一个核苷酸的磷酸键合时开始聚合，其形成核酸链的**糖-磷酸骨架**。关键点在于特定类型核酸的核苷酸总是含有相同的糖和磷酸盐分子，它们的区别仅在于它们对碱基的选择。因此，核酸的一条链可以仅基于其碱基的顺序与另一条链区分开;碱基的这种排序定义了核酸的**主要结构**。\n",

    "For example, Figure 2 shows a strand of **deoxyribose nucleic acid** (DNA), in which the sugar is called **deoxyribose**, and the only four choices for nucleobases are molecules called **adenine** (A), **cytosine** (C), **guanine** (G), and **thymine** (T).\n",
